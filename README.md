Hello and Welcome to the project Page!

InspirAItion is a streamlit website that seeks to use generative AI to help ttrpg enthusiasts to easily make NPC stats, location information, and quests

This project is still very much in the Alpha-build phase and as such is still missing some features and runs a little slow!

The current contributors to this project are Ethan Haarer and Razvan Beldeanu

Future implementations we hope to add:
 - Questline Generation
 - City Map Generation
 - PC generation
 - improving NPC generation
 - exporting generated content
